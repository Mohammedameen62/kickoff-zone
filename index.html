                <h2><a href="blog-details.html">History Of Football</a></h2>
                <p class="mb-4 d-block">Football, known as soccer in some countries, has a long and rich history that dates back thousands of years. The earliest known versions of the game were played in ancient civilizations such as China, Greece, and Rome. The Chinese game "Cuju," played during the Han Dynasty (206 BC–220 AD), is considered one of the oldest forms of football, where players kicked a leather ball into a net without using their hands. Similar games appeared in medieval Europe, including "mob football" in England, where large groups played chaotic matches with minimal rules.<br>Modern football began to take shape in England during the 19th century. Different schools and clubs played their own versions of the game, leading to confusion over rules. In 1863, the Football Association (FA) was formed in London, establishing standardized rules and officially separating football from rugby. This led to the creation of association football, which spread rapidly across Britain and the world. By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, football clubs and competitions started forming in various countries, including Spain, Italy, and Germany, leading to the global growth of the sport.</p>
